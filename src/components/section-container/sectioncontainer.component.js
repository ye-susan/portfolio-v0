                Hi there! ðŸ¤“
                I'm a full-stack developer currently volunteering at Hack for LA (where I write documentation and assist with adding new features to the site).

                I'm always looking to learn about new (tech/productivity hacks/relaxing shows/hikes/books/cultures) and looking forward to meeting fellow engineers ðŸ‘¯ - connect with me on LinkedIn!
                Feel free to reach out to me if you're also interested in getting involved in Hack for LA/civic tech.
            </p>
